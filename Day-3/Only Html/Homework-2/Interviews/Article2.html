            Tony received his PhD from McMaster University with distinction in theory and is an award-winning teacher. He has taught
            at McMaster University, the University of Western Ontario, the University of Toronto, and the University of New
            Brunswick, where he has been professor of economics since 1992. His research interests have included stabilization
            policy, the supply-side effects of interest rates, labor market discrimination, unemployment rate disparities, and the
            methods and content of economic education. He has developed several different introductory courses as vehicles for
            teaching principles of economics, including “Economics of everyday life,” “Economics in the real world,” and “Economics
            through film.” None of them have been as successful as the critical perspectives approach embodied in this book. Along
            with Rod Hill, he is the author of The Microeconomics Anti-Textbook.

                Tony Myatt is a professor of economics in Canada and author, with Rod Hill, of the Economics Anti-Textbook in 2010. He
                has recently published the Macro Economics Anti-Textbook. The Mint asked him about the inspiration of these textbooks,
                what traction they have gained compared to standard textbooks, and why mainstream economics is so averse to critical
                thinking. It turns out the original textbook was the most illegally-downloaded eBook ever published by Zed books and led
                to a lost job for one academic.
