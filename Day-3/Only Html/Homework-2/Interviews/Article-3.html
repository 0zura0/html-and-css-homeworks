            Professor Alan Kirman became a complexity economist before the term was invented. Having trained in equilibrium
            economics, his intellectual curiosity led him to do something few economists actually do: study how markets work in
            reality rather than theory.
            
            As chief adviser to the OECD’s New Approaches to Economic Challenges initiative, he has also sought to apply this
            approach to policy development. The Mint caught up with him following his Festschrift at the Bank of England to find out
            more about his intellectual journey.</p>

                Alan P. Kirman (born January 16 , 1939) is an economist , university professor and director of studies at the École des
                Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales , of British and French nationality 1 . Starting from the study of the heart of
                orthodox economics (L’ Équilibre général 2 ) “he evolved towards a progressively more critical position, exploring the
                limits of economic analysis”

                At the frontiers of economic analysis, Alan Kirman is interested in the actual functioning of markets and the effective
                behavior of participants. As soon as the interaction between agents is taken into account, the relationships between
                individual actions and global phenomena become complex. He then considers that it is preferable to consider economic
                activity as the product of the composition of the individual actions of the agents interacting in a self-organized
                complex system rather than as the result of the aggregation of isolated individual maximization behaviors. Analyzing
                real markets helps us understand these types of phenomena</p>
