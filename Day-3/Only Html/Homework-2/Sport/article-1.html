            The curtains closed on Monday night for the Boston Celtics’s Jekyll and Hyde routine.
            One hundred fifty N.B.A. teams had tried and failed to overcome a 3-0 playoff series deficit. The Celtics made it 
            151 with their loss against the Miami Heat in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. The final game in a series 
            full of momentum swings was not competitive: Miami led by double digits for most of the night and won comfortably, 
            103-84. It was Boston’s third home loss of the series and a bitter disappointment for a team that reached the N.B.A. 
            finals last season and had been expecting to return.

        “We failed, I failed,” a despondent Jaylen Brown told reporters after the game. “We let the whole city down.”
        For much of the regular season and this playoff run, the Celtics alternated between looking like an unstoppable offensive 
        juggernaut (Games 4 and 5 against Miami) and appearing listless and uninspired (Games 3 and 7). Very few leading contenders 
        for a championship have vacillated as wildly from night to night, from dominant to dominated, as the Celtics had this season.
        But entering the playoffs, the Celtics still harbored championship hopes, confident that their franchise centerpieces, 
        Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, and a versatile roster ready to supplement them would find a way to win.

                The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. 
                The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference 
                Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games 
                at TD Garden, which is also the home of the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are one of the most 
                successful basketball teams in NBA history. The franchise's 17 NBA championships are the joint most of any team, alongside the 
                Los Angeles Lakers. The Celtics currently hold the record for the most recorded wins of any NBA team.

            For most of their careers, Tatum, 25, and Brown, 26, had led unexpectedly deep postseason runs. 
            Beating expectations became their brand. This year was their fourth time making at least the conference 
            finals in the past six years.
