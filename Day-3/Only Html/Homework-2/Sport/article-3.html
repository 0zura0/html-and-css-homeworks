        <p>
            Almost a year after one of England’s richest and most decorated soccer teams opened an investigation into a senior
            executive accused of workplace bullying so severe that several staff members said colleagues took mental health leave to
            escape it, the team, Chelsea F.C., confirmed that the executive has left the club.
            
            The accusations against the executive, the former Chelsea director of marketing Gary Twelvetree, were outlined in a
            report in The New York Times last June that detailed mounting concerns about a toxic workplace culture inside the
            department he led. The Times article was based on interviews with almost a dozen Chelsea employees who described how
            being humiliated and berated in front of colleagues had become commonplace in the club’s marketing department. </p>
        <p>  
            Chelsea declined to comment on any aspect of its investigation but did confirm that Twelvetree no longer worked at the
            club. Twelvetree did not respond to telephone and text messages requesting comment.

                Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based in Fulham, West London. Founded in 1905, they play
                their home games at Stamford Bridge.[4] The club competes in the Premier League, the top division of English football.
                They won their first major honour, the League championship, in 1955. The club won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970,
                their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup
                in 2022.

            He had not returned to the team’s offices at its Stamford Bridge stadium since the allegations against him surfaced in
            the Times article, team employees said, but remained on the payroll for months until his exit. Several employees said
            the team’s failure to inform them of the findings of its investigation had only created new frustration inside the club.
            The pressure of working under Twelvetree’s leadership led multiple employees to quit their jobs. Others took medical
            leaves that in some cases lasted months. Several of the employees came forward after the death in January 2022 of a
            former well-liked member of the department, Richard Bignell, who killed himself after being forced out at Chelsea.
