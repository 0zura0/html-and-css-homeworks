            The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority gathered Kentucky state regulatory veterinarians, along with vets from
            Churchill Downs, on Tuesday
            to examine why 12 horses have been fatally injured at the historic racetrack in a matter of weeks and to decide whether
            to recommend pausing racing there.
            Lisa Lazarus, the chief executive of the authority, called the “emergency veterinary summit” in Lexington, Ky., to
            review necropsies, toxicology reports
            and veterinarians’ and trainers’ notes on the deaths, seven of which preceded this month’s Kentucky Derby. The deaths
            have cast a pall over the Triple Crown
            season, the few weeks each spring when casual sports fans have heightened focus on horse racing.

            In addition, the authority has asked a longtime California track superintendent, Dennis Moore, to examine the racing
            surfaces at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., and offer an independent analysis of the dirt and turf courses’
            suitability for racing.
            “I have not had a single jockey or trainer tell me that they believe the track is a factor in these fatalities,” Lazarus
            said. Most of the deaths occurred after horses broke down while racing.

                Horse racing is an equestrian performance sport, typically involving two or more horses ridden by jockeys (or sometimes
                driven without riders) over a set distance for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all sports, as its basic
                premise – to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance – has been mostly
                unchanged since at least classical antiquity.
                
                Horse races vary widely in format, and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport.
                Variations include restricting races to particular breeds, running over obstacles, running over different distances,
                running on different track surfaces, and running in different gaits. In some races, horses are assigned different
                weights to carry to reflect differences in ability, a process known as handicapping.
                
                While horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing's interest and economic importance is in
                the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2019 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115
                billion.</p>

            Along with a review of the protocols Kentucky state veterinarians follow to make sure horses are fit to race, Lazarus
            said that vet records would be scoured for illegal or misused drugs. She said the authority will apply “very intense
            scrutiny from a testing standpoint to any horse that we’re concerned about” as well as increased surveillance and
            attention on their trainers.
            
            The reviews of the veterinary and medication history of each horse were led by Dr. Jennifer Durenberger, the authority’s
            director of equine safety and welfare.
            
            “It’s basically trying to get a whole snapshot of that horse’s history in the month leading up to the injury,” Lazarus
            said. “We have to turn over every leaf, look under every stone.”
            
            She said her agency will have a recommendation from the summit by the end of the day Wednesday about whether and how
            Churchill should proceed with racing.
