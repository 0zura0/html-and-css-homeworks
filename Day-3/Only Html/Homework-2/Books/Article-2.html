        <center><figcaption>Well known as a humorist, Paul Rudnick delivers an emotional romance amid the one-liners in his new novel.</figcaption></center>
        <p>
            Nate Reminger, a New Jersey-born, gay, Jewish and unabashedly horny virgin, shows up at Yale University in 1973 and
            instantly sets his sights on the one man he’ll be gazing at for the next four decades.
            
            As a budding writer with a knack for shrewd description, Nate spends the length of Paul Rudnick’s life-filled rom-com
            trying to find ways to describe that man, Farrell Covington: He is a “blinding sun god,” a “blank check,” an “unhinged
            cipher” and more. In so doing, Nate also reaches for a new way of seeing himself and what he believes to be possible for
            two men in love.
            
            To Nate’s surprise, Farrell returns his gaze with an even stronger intensity. It supersedes the look of a crush — it’s
            an appraisal, a reverie. </p>
        <p>  
            And of the pair, Farrell is the one with an eye for beauty. A devastatingly handsome, unimaginably wealthy aesthete,
            Farrell considers style his armor — “a form of protest, against gross inhumanity or inclement weather.” As the scion of
            an ultraconservative family, he is not so much the black sheep as the gilded one. He speaks in a mid-Atlantic accent
            that sounds “as if a person had been raised by a bottle of good whiskey and a crystal chandelier.” He is, as the kids
            would later say, everything.
            
            He and Nate quickly become everything to each other, and though Farrell has the kind of charmed life that allows him to
            avoid such inconveniences as Yale’s housing rules — he has a townhouse, with an original Hockney and a butler — it will
            not shield him from bigoted parents hellbent on keeping their son on the straight and narrow. Nate and Farrell are
            separated against their will, sending Nate spiraling downward and beginning a pattern of estrangement and reunion that
            recurs throughout the novel. </p>

                Paul Rudnick (born December 29, 1957) is an American writer. His plays have been produced both on and off Broadway and
                around the world. He is also known for having written the screenplays for several movies, including Sister Act, Addams
                Family Values, Jeffrey, and In & Out.
                Ben Brantley, when reviewing Rudnick's The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told in The New York Times, wrote that, "Line by
                line, Mr. Rudnick may be the funniest writer for the stage in the United States today."

        <p>
            The irony of Farrell’s charmed life is that it serves as the complicating factor in the couple’s relationship, as they
            move from college to New York to Hollywood and beyond, all while navigating the AIDS epidemic, crises of faith and a
            family that rivals the Ewings of “Dallas” for wealthy wickedness.
            While the endeavor is quite epic in scope, it’s made deliciously bite-size by Rudnick’s densely funny writing style and
            the gimlet eye he has given Nate, a clear avatar for the author in this semiautobiographical tome. “I had vague
            theatrical ambitions,” he tells us, “as an actor or playwright or simply someone who’d call other people ‘darling.’”
