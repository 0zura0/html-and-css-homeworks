            Don’t let the adorable title fool you: As Scott J. Shapiro acknowledges in “Fancy Bear Goes Phishing,” his
            new book
            about cybersecurity, hacking can inflict terrible harm. Shapiro is the author, with Oona A. Hathaway, of
            “The
            Internationalists” (2017), which recounts 20th-century efforts to outlaw war; among the numerous questions
            animating
            “Fancy Bear Goes Phishing” is whether hacking has opened the door to war by other means.

            After all, “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear” refer to the cyberespionage units linked to Russian intelligence
            that gained
            access to the Democratic National Committee’s computer systems before the 2016 presidential election. Fancy
            Bear
            released a trove of emails that included Hillary Clinton’s closed-door speeches to Goldman Sachs and her
            campaign
            chairman’s tips for risotto.

            The hack was undeniably embarrassing, and the 2016 election results ended up being so close that it’s
            impossible to say
            whether the drip-drip-drip of leaked emails was a factor in turning a roiling tide in Donald J. Trump’s
            favor. Not to
            mention that hacking into the D.N.C.’s systems “was a standard act of espionage,” Shapiro writes, and
            espionage happens
            to be legal under international law. Spies like to go phishing — so what? It’s what they do with their catch
            that’s the
            real question. In “releasing the pilfered information” for the world to see, “Fancy Bear might have engaged
            in an act of
            war.”

                Scott Shapiro is the Charles F. Southmayd Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at Yale Law
                School. His areas of
                interest include jurisprudence, international law, constitutional law, criminal law and cybersecurity.

            The business with the D.N.C. is one. The others involve the Morris Worm, which infected the early internet
            in 1988 and happened to be created by the son of the chief scientist for computer security at the National
            Security Agency; the 1990s malware handiwork of a Bulgarian hacker known as the Dark Avenger; the 2005 hack
            into Paris Hilton’s cellphone by a 16-year-old boy; and the “Mirai botnet,” a networked supercomputer
            developed in 2016 by three teenagers that gathered strength by secretly conscripting so-called smart
            appliances, like security cameras and toasters.
