                Rita Chang-Eppig received her MFA in fiction from NYU. Her novel about an infamous Chinese pirate queen, Deep as the

            In the early 19th century, Ching Shih, or Cheng I Sao, who would have been called Shek Yeung, rose from prostitution to
            command tens of thousands of pirates in the South China Sea. Despite the clear dramatic and romantic potential of her
            story, to the best of my knowledge, before 2019, Ching Shih’s fictional appearances in English were limited to
            children’s books and cameo roles, including as Moag in the second book of R.F. Kuang’s “The Poppy War” trilogy and
            Mistress Ching in the third “Pirates of the Caribbean” film. This neglect has been addressed in recent years: Autumn
            Bardot self-published “Dragon Lady” in 2019, and in 2021, Top Floor Books published Larry Feign’s highly detailed “The
            Flower Boat Girl.” Rita Chang-Eppig’s debut novel, “Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea,” now joins them.

            The book opens with Shek Yeung’s husband, Cheng Yat, receiving a mortal injury. His dying wish is for the pirate
            confederation he established to continue. To carry out that wish, Shek Yeung negotiates a marriage to his heir, Cheung
            Po, with the promise of a son.

            Despite the fearsomeness of the historical figure, Chang-Eppig’s Shek Yeung is pensive and passive. She spends more time
            pondering and reminiscing than swashbuckling or scheming. In combat and at sea, the novel remains impersonal, and most
            events are narrated rather than experienced. When Shek Yeung disembowels a man, we do not see, hear, feel or smell
            anything. The book’s more vivid moments are land-bound and domestic, including a striking scene in which the
            protagonist, as a child, helps butcher an eel; a stroll through a village where cooking smells waft out of windows; and
            depictions of traditional rituals during Shek Yeung’s pregnancy and childbirth. Only in the last 100 pages, when the
            Qing emperor’s pirate hunter, Pak Ling, becomes a credible threat, does Shek Yeung blossom into her namesake and act
            with vitality and resolve.

            The book’s weaknesses include erratic pacing and unskillful language. Though the final third of the novel flows
            smoothly, earlier battles and conversations are broken up by paragraphs of exposition, dissipating interest. Because the
            novel’s sentences are rough-hewn, and anything that happens is relentlessly explained, with little left for the reader
            to interpret or infer, the book gives the impression of having been written for a younger audience.

With some regularity, the author chooses words that are close but not quite right (fish are “incandescent” rather than
phosphorescent; bravado is “indigenous” to young men rather than innate or common; a conversation is described as
“lulling” into silence rather than subsiding or sinking). She also leaves verbal trip hazards lying about, including an
unfortunate comparison of Shek Yeung to her semi-flat-bottomed junk. If language serves as the writer’s paints and
brushes, the colors here are muddled, the brushwork hesitant.
